# gitloom.nvim — Specification

This is the behavioral contract: *what* gitloom does, independent of *how*
it is implemented. Implementation details live in
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

This document is authoritative. When behavior changes, update this file
first (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) → Spec-First Development).

## 1. Purpose and scope

gitloom's primary goal is to be an excellent **git graph viewer**. The graph
is the product. Other git functionality is deliberately out of scope, except
where it falls naturally *out of* the graph (e.g. acting on the commit under
the cursor) or is delegated to an existing plugin (e.g. opening a diff in
diffview).

### 1.1 Own the model

gitloom does **not** wrap `git log --graph`. It reads commit and ref data
from git and builds the commit DAG, the row ordering, and the lane layout
itself, in memory. Owning the model is a hard requirement, not an
implementation detail: the planned view features — collapsing, pinning,
toggling branch visibility, and reflowing (§10) — are only possible if
gitloom controls ordering and layout rather than delegating them to git.

Today the view is read-only and shows a single fixed projection of the graph.
The view-transformation features in §10 are the direction this is built
toward; the current non-graph surface (window, streaming fetch, rendering)
exists primarily to exercise and validate the graph algorithm.

## 2. Entry point

- `:GitloomGraph` opens the graph for the repository at Neovim's current
  working directory.
- The window is a floating window. `q` closes it; `m` cycles the merge/split
  rendering style (§5.2) so the styles can be compared at a glance; `M` toggles
  graph mirroring (§5.4); `<CR>` opens the **commit view** for the commit on
  the current row (§11); `D` opens that commit's diff in an external diff viewer
  via the configured provider (§11.5). Two debug
  aids: `K` opens a float with the full lane breakdown for the commit under
  the cursor, and `i` toggles the per-lane id column before the message (a
debug aid, hidden by default). `d` toggles the date column between absolute and
relative (§6). `H` toggles reachability highlighting (§12) off and on.
  `?` opens a float listing all keybindings. The footer shows live status
  (the active mode, and `(mirrored)` when mirroring is on).
- **Navigation.** Navigation is line-by-line (`j`/`k`, arrows, etc. move whole
  rows), with `cursorline` marking the current row (§7). The cursor is parked at
  the **commit message** rather than left at column 0. `h`/`l` move a selection
  across the current row's ref decorations — the branch groups then tags (§6);
  the selected decoration is highlighted (`palette.selected`) **and the cursor
  moves onto it**. The message is the default position (the cursor parks there);
  since refs are pinned to the right edge, `l` moves **right** onto the refs
  (starting at the first) and `h` moves **left** back toward the message.
  Selection clamps at the last ref and resets to the message when the cursor
  moves to another row. This selection is the substrate for the planned
  per-branch actions (collapse / hide / pin, §10); it has no effect yet. The
  row under the cursor also defines a **pivot** whose reachable history
  (ancestors and descendants) is emphasised while everything else dims (§12).
- The view opens immediately and is populated asynchronously as git output
  arrives; the window must not block on git completing.

## 3. Data source

Two independent queries, joined by commit hash.

### 3.1 Commits

Commits are read via `git log` with:

- `--topo-order` — topological ordering (children before parents).
- `--parents` — full parent hash list per commit.
- a refspec, default `--all`.

Each commit carries: hash, parent hashes, author, author date, subject. The
author date is read as a Unix epoch (`%at`) plus its tz offset (from `%ai`) and
parsed into a structured `Timestamp` (§4), not kept as text. Refs are **not**
taken from `--decorate`; they come from §3.2.

### 3.2 Refs

Refs are read via `git for-each-ref` over `refs/heads`, `refs/remotes`, and
`refs/tags`, yielding for each ref its refname, target hash, and — for
annotated tags — the dereferenced commit hash. The current branch is read via
`git symbolic-ref` (HEAD). Each ref is resolved to the `Commit` it points at
by hash (§4.1).

Using a dedicated, structured query rather than parsing `git log --decorate`
makes ref discovery robust and makes remote branches and annotated tags
first-class (the decorate field conflated them and dropped remotes).

## 4. Data model

```
Commit    = { hash, parents: Commit[], children: Commit[], refs: Ref[],
              author, date: Timestamp, message }
Ref       = { name, kind, commit: Commit }
Timestamp = { epoch, offset, raw }
```

- `Commit.date` is a parsed `Timestamp`, not a string: `epoch` is the author
  date as Unix time (UTC), `offset` is the author's tz offset in seconds (so
  the author's local wall-clock is `epoch + offset`), and `raw` keeps the
  original `%ai` text. Formatting happens at render time (§6).
- `Ref.kind` is one of `local`, `remote`, `tag`, `head`.
- `Ref.commit` is the `Commit` the ref points at — a **direct reference, not a
  hash**. `Commit.refs` lists the refs pointing at it (the inverse). A
  name → `Ref` registry is kept on the repository.
- Commits are identity-stable: a commit referenced as a parent (or by a ref)
  before it is seen in the log is the *same* object once its own log line
  arrives.
- Every hash reference resolves to a `Commit`: parent hashes and ref targets
  become `Commit` references once resolved. A target not in the fetched range
  still exists as a (sparse) `Commit` placeholder so the graph and refs stay
  connected, filled in when (if) its log line arrives.
- Child links are the inverse of parent links.

### 4.1 Ref resolution

Each ref is classified by its refname and resolved to its target commit:

| refname                          | kind     | name shown            |
|----------------------------------|----------|-----------------------|
| `refs/heads/<name>`              | `local`  | `<name>`              |
| `refs/remotes/<remote>/<name>`   | `remote` | `<remote>/<name>`     |
| `refs/tags/<name>`               | `tag`    | `<name>` (annotated tags resolved to their commit via the dereferenced hash) |
| HEAD (symbolic)                  | `head`   | marks the current branch's commit; a detached HEAD is not marked (current limitation) |

`refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD` (the remote's default-branch symref) is skipped.
The target hash is looked up in the commit table; a missing target yields a
sparse `Commit` placeholder (as above).

## 5. Graph layout

The layout is the visual projection of the commit graph. Its vocabulary, from
the model outward:

- **Commit** — a node in the DAG (§4).
- **Lane** — one drawn **edge, child → parent**:

  ```
  Lane = { id, begin: Commit, end: Commit, highlighted: bool }
  ```

  `begin` is the child (above), `end` the parent (below); `id` drives colour
  (kept continuous along a first-parent chain, so a line of history reads as one
  colour); `highlighted` marks it for the reachability emphasis (§12). There is
  one Lane per parent/child edge. *(A future **Route** — a contiguous run of
  Lanes forming a path — is not modelled yet.)*
- **OrderItem** — the visual unit for one Commit: its order position, the Commit
  it shows, the Lanes incident to it (`parent_lanes` out to its parents,
  `child_lanes` in from its children), and its rendered **Lines**. This is the
  commit ↔ visual bridge.
- **Line** — one rendered row: a sequence of **Columns**. An OrderItem has a
  *commit line* and, per the merge style (§5.2), an optional *split line* (above)
  and/or *merge line* (below). Exactly one Commit's node sits on the commit line;
  the split/merge lines carry only wires.
- **Column** — one cell of a Line: the **Segments** through it, plus the Commit
  node when one sits here. *(Named `Track` in the code for now; `Column` is the
  intended name — a deferred rename.)*
- **Segment** — a single wire within a Column: its `connectivity`
  {up, down, left, right} and the **Lane(s)** it carries. One Segment per Column
  normally; two where wires cross. A shared fan **bus** Segment carries the *set*
  of edges routing through it, and so is highlighted when *any* of them is — this
  is what makes the reachability emphasis exact across splits and merges (§12).

The graph is walked top to bottom (newest heads on top, roots at the bottom), so
a Lane's `begin` (child) is always already placed when its `end` (parent) is
reached. A Column's rendered **glyph** is a function of the union of its
Segments' connectivity; its **colour** is one carried Lane's `id`, chosen by a
"top" strategy that prefers a highlighted Lane (§12).

### 5.1 Invariants

- **One commit per Line.** Exactly one Commit's node is placed on a commit line;
  the virtual split/merge lines carry none.
- **Two-sided Segments.** Each Segment touches exactly two of its Column's sides
  (a wire enters and exits) — one side only at an endpoint (a Lane's `begin` or
  `end`). This forces crossings (`─│─`) and tees to be modelled as *separate*
  Segments, not one over-connected wire.
- **Every Lane is an edge.** A Lane has both a `begin` (child) and an `end`
  (parent), both placed Commits (or the fetched-range boundary). Its Segments run
  from `begin`'s line down to `end`'s line; no Lane fizzles into nothing.
- **Edge attribution.** Each Segment carries the actual Lane(s) it draws — the
  edge `(begin, end)` — so two wires that share a Column or cross stay distinct
  by edge identity. A shared fan **bus** Segment carries the set of edges routing
  through it.
- **Per-Lane continuity.** A Segment of Lane L with `down` on one Line meets a
  Segment of the *same* Lane L with `up` in the same Column on the next Line.
- **Colour comes from a carried Lane.** A Column's colour is the `id` of one Lane
  on one of its Segments.
- **Connectivity consistency.** The glyph's wired sides equal the union of the
  Column's Segments' connectivity (every wired side has a Segment providing it).
- Merges (commit with >1 parent) fan out `parent_lanes`; splits (>1 child) fan in
  `child_lanes`.

Edge attribution (`begin`/`end` per Lane, and a Segment's edge set) is the model
contract that makes the §12 reachability emphasis exact and the planned §10 view
work and lane navigation possible. The handoff split (an incoming child-lane and
an outgoing parent-lane sharing a column) remains two distinct Lanes.

### 5.2 Merge style

`merge_style` selects where merges and splits are drawn:

- `split_on_separate_line` — when set and a commit has >1 child, the fan-in
  is drawn on a virtual line **above** the commit row.
- `merge_on_separate_line` — when set and a commit has >1 parent, the fan-out
  is drawn on a virtual line **below** the commit row.
- `allow_merge_on_split` — permits placing a merge onto a split lane when
  merges are folded onto the commit line. In this mode an incoming child-lane
  and an outgoing parent-lane can share a column (a "lane handoff"): the cell's
  `up` segment and `down` segment belong to *different* lanes. The **model**
  represents these faithfully as two separate lanes (so per-lane continuity
  holds); the **rendered** glyph is a single cell that can only show one
  color, so its color is best-effort and may read as continuous across the
  handoff. The model is the contract here, not the coloring.

When a separate line is not used, the merge/split is folded onto the commit
row itself.

### 5.3 Glyphs

Lanes render as box-drawing characters derived from connectivity
(`│ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ╭ ╮ ╯ ╰ ─` and the terminal half-segments). Commit markers:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `◎`    | root commit (no parents) |
| `◉`    | tip commit (no children) |
| `○`    | ordinary commit |
| merge icon | merge commit when merges are folded onto the line and `icons.merge` is set |

### 5.4 Mirroring

By default the graph is **mirrored**: the cell sequence of each row is reversed
and each cell's `left`/`right` connectivity is swapped before glyphs are
derived, so the graph reads right-to-left with lane 1 at the **right** edge of
the graph column, nearest the commit message. The graph column is right-aligned
(padded on the left) so vertical wires stay column-aligned across rows of
differing lane counts. Setting `mirror = false` (§8) renders it the
conventional way, left-to-right with lane 1 at the left.

Mirroring is purely a rendering transform: the commit ordering, the lane
layout, and the lane model (ids, `child`/`parent`, per-lane continuity) are
unchanged — only the projection to glyphs is flipped. Because the glyph is a
pure function of connectivity (§5), the mirrored glyphs (`╭`↔`╮`, `┤`↔`├`,
`╴`↔`╶`) and the inter-lane connectors fall out of the model with no separate
glyph-swap table, and color (lane id) is preserved. All §5.1 invariants hold on
the mirrored output.

## 6. Row content

A commit row displays, left to right:

1. author date — formatted from the `Timestamp` (§4) either as an **absolute**
   author-local time (via the configurable `date_format`, default
   `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`) or as a **relative** age (e.g. `3 days ago`). The
   `date_mode` selects which; `d` toggles it live.
2. author name
3. graph lanes (glyphs)
4. commit subject (the message)
5. ref decorations, pinned to the **right edge** of the row

The date, author, and graph are width-aligned across visible rows. The message
and refs share the remaining width **per row** (not as a fixed aligned column,
so navigation stays line-by-line): the refs are right-aligned at the window
edge and the message fills the gap, truncated with `…` when it does not fit.

**Ref decorations** — a `HEAD` marker on the current branch, then branch
groups, then tags as `[name]`. Branch refs (local + remote) that share a
**short name** collapse into one group: the name is shown once, followed by the
remotes that also point at this commit, as `(name ↑remote1,remote2)`. The name
is highlighted when a local branch exists and dimmed when the group is
remote-only. A local branch with no matching remotes is just `(name)`. This
keeps the common case (a branch plus its remote-tracking copies all at one
commit) from repeating the name per remote.

**Ref width budget.** The refs use the row's free width: they may take
everything the message does not need — its natural width, but never reserving
more than `message_min` (§8). So refs fill empty space when the message is
short, while a long message still keeps at least `message_min` columns
(truncated with `…`). Ref labels are shown in order (leftmost first) until the
budget is reached; labels that do not fit collapse into a trailing `+N` overflow
marker. Each field is colored by its `palette` highlight group; lanes are
colored by lane id cycled through `palette.tracks`.

The `h`/`l` selection (§2) cycles all of a row's ref decorations. One collapsed
into the `+N` overflow can still be selected, but until it is visible it is not
highlighted and the cursor falls back to the message (revisited with the §10
actions).

## 7. Rendering behavior

- Rendering is **viewport-driven**: only rows within the visible range are
  laid out and drawn. Scrolling triggers layout of newly visible rows.
- The view updates incrementally as commits stream in.
- The buffer is non-modifiable to the user (`nofile`, read-only).
- The window uses `cursorline` as the current-row indicator and keeps the
  cursor parked at the commit message (or, when a ref is selected, on that ref);
  see §2.
- The pivot's reachability cone is emphasised by dimming everything outside it
  (§12); the cone is recomputed on row change, over the visible rows.

## 8. Configuration

`GraphOptions` (see [README.md](README.md) for the full default table):

```
GraphOptions = { win, palette, merge_style, icons, branches, mirror, highlight,
                 date_format, date_mode, message_min, diff }
MergeStyle   = { allow_merge_on_split, merge_on_separate_line, split_on_separate_line }
Diff         = { open: fun(range: DiffRange), label: string }
DiffRange    = { rev: string, from: Commit?, to: Commit }
```

- `win` — floating-window geometry (snacks.win).
- `palette` — highlight group per field, plus a `tracks` list cycled by lane id.
  Includes `selected`, the highlight for the `h`/`l`-selected ref decoration
  (§2; default `Visual`); `diff`, a sub-table of highlight groups for the
  commit view's diff: `add`, `delete`, `hunk`, `header` (defaults `DiffAdd`,
  `DiffDelete`, `Title`, `Comment`; §11.3); and `action`, the highlight for the
  commit view's diff action label (default `Special`; §11.5); and `dim`, the
  blend factor (`0`–`1`) toward the window background used to de-emphasise
  out-of-cone rows and lanes (§12; default `0.6`; higher is more muted). On
  terminals without true colour, dimming falls back to a flat `NonText`
  highlight instead.
- `highlight` — whether reachability dimming (§12) starts enabled. **Default
  true.** Toggle live with `H`.
- `branches` — ref argument(s) for `git log` (default `--all`).
- `mirror` — render the graph mirrored with lane 1 at the right edge of the
  graph column, nearest the message (§5.4). **Default true.** Set false for the
  conventional left-to-right layout. Purely a rendering transform; ordering and
  lane layout are unchanged. Toggle live with `M`.
- `date_format` — `os.date` format string for absolute dates (default
  `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`), rendered in the author's local time.
- `date_mode` — `absolute` (default) or `relative`; selects the initial date
  rendering (§6). Toggle live with `d`.
- `message_min` — the minimum width always kept for the message (default `24`);
  the right-pinned refs use the rest of the free width, with overflow becoming
  `+N` (§6).
- `diff` — the external diff provider (§11.5): `open` is a function called with a
  `DiffRange` to open the diff (default opens diffview), and `label` is the
  commit view's action-label text (default `▶ Open diff (diffview)`). Override
  `open`/`label` to use a different diff plugin; set `open` to `nil`/`false` to
  disable the integration (no action label, `D` is a no-op).

### Known gap: setup() wiring

`require("gitloom").setup(opts)` stores `opts` in the module config, but the
`:GitloomGraph` command currently invokes the graph with built-in defaults
and does **not** read that stored config. Forwarding `setup()` config to the
command is unimplemented. Until then, the documented defaults always apply to
`:GitloomGraph`. (Programmatic callers may pass options directly to the graph
open function.)

## 9. Non-goals

**Permanently** out of scope: repository mutation of any kind (no checkout,
commit, rebase, reset). gitloom is a viewer.

Acting on the commit under the cursor is reasonable where it arises naturally
from the graph, and the **commit view** (§11) is the first realization of it: a
read-only detail view of the selected commit, including its diff. Integration
with external diff plugins is realized through a pluggable provider (§11.5,
default diffview) rather than gitloom rendering its own rich diff. These are
secondary to the graph itself and must not compromise the model-ownership
principle (§1.1).

## 10. Planned: view model and transformations

> Status: **direction, not yet implemented.** This section records intended
> behavior so design and code can converge on it. It does not describe
> current behavior.

The graph is a *projection* of the full in-memory commit model under a
**view state**. Changing the view state reflows the graph.

### 10.1 Branch visibility

Each branch (identified by a ref / head) has a visibility mode:

- **visible** — its commits are shown in full.
- **collapsed** — its commits are represented compactly (conceptually a
  single row) while connectivity to visible lanes is preserved.
- **hidden** — its commits are removed from the view.

Toggling a branch's mode reflows the graph to match.

### 10.2 Pinned heads

A branch head may be **pinned**. Pinning guarantees that everything the
pinned head references (its reachable history, subject to the attribution
rule in §10.4) stays visible regardless of other visibility settings.

### 10.3 Reflow

Any change to view state produces a freshly computed ordering + lane layout
over the visible/collapsed commit set — recomputed from scratch, not
appended. Reflow must be deterministic and stable enough that unaffected
regions of the graph do not visually churn.

### 10.4 Open design questions

These must be specified before implementation:

- **Commit attribution (the central problem).** Commits are shared across
  branches in a DAG. Collapsing or hiding "a branch" requires a precise rule
  for which commits belong to that branch versus are shared with retained
  branches — e.g. first-parent ownership, or reachable-minus-other-retained-
  heads. Pinning and hiding both depend on this rule.
- **Collapsed rendering.** What a collapsed branch's single row shows
  (summary, commit count) and how merges into/out of it connect to visible
  lanes.
- **Hidden connectivity.** Whether a merge from a hidden branch into a
  visible one leaves a phantom indicator or vanishes entirely.
- **Scale.** Reading all commits is unbounded in large repositories; the
  loading strategy (limits, lazy/streamed loading, on-demand reachability)
  must keep reflow responsive.

## 11. Commit view

Pressing `<CR>` on a commit row opens the **commit view**: a separate read-only
floating window showing the full details of that one commit. `q` closes it. Like
the graph, it is a viewer — it never mutates the repository (§9).

### 11.1 Data source

The commit view's data is fetched **on demand** when it is opened — a single
`git show -s` for the selected commit's hash — *not* taken from the streaming
graph model. The graph model (§3, §4) deliberately carries only what the graph
needs (author, author date, subject); the richer per-commit detail (email,
committer, full message body) is read only when a commit is actually opened, so
the streaming path stays lean. The refs shown are the row's existing decorations
(§6), reused from the model rather than re-queried.

The diff is fetched the same way, on demand, by a second `git show --format= -p`
for the commit, chained after the metadata fetch; the view renders once both
arrive.

### 11.2 Content

The first line is the **diff action label** (§11.5) — when a diff provider is
configured — and the cursor is parked on it when the view opens, so `<CR>`
(open the commit view) then `<CR>` (on the focused label) opens the diff. Below
it the view shows, in order:

1. the full commit hash;
2. the ref decorations on the commit (the same compact groups as §6), when any;
3. the **author** — name, email, and date;
4. the **committer** — name, email, and date — shown **only when it differs**
   from the author (the common case where they match is omitted to reduce
   noise);
5. the parent commits (abbreviated hashes), when any;
6. the full commit message — subject and body — indented;
7. the **diffstat** — the list of changed files with per-file insertion /
   deletion counts (§11.4) — shown between the message and the diff;
8. the commit's diff (the patch), shown below the diffstat.

The author and committer dates are shown as `git show` renders them
(`--date=iso`); the structured `Timestamp` formatting of §6 applies to the graph
date column, not here.

### 11.3 Diff

The commit view shows the commit's diff below the diffstat (§11.4). Highlighting is
**line-level** (matching git's default and lazygit/tig): each patch line is
colored by its role — added, removed, hunk header (`@@ … @@`), and file header
(`diff --git`, `index`, `---`/`+++`, mode/rename/new-file lines); context lines
are uncolored. The highlight groups come from `palette.diff` (§8), using
always-defined UI groups by default, applied as extmarks — the view does **not**
switch the buffer to `filetype=diff`, so the custom metadata header above stays
unaffected. Language-aware (intra-line) syntax highlighting of the diff content
is a possible future enhancement.

### 11.4 Changed-files list (diffstat)

Between the message and the diff, the commit view shows a **diffstat**: a
summary line (`N files changed, X insertions(+), Y deletions(-)`) followed by one
line per changed file — the path, its insertion/deletion counts, and a colored
`+`/`-` bar (the `+` segment in `palette.diff.add`, the `-` in
`palette.diff.delete`; §8). Renames are shown as `old => new`; a binary file
shows `Bin` instead of counts.

The diffstat is **derived from the same patch** that §11.3 renders — not a
separate query — so the file list, the counts, and each file's location in the
diff all come from one source.

Pressing `<CR>` on a changed-file line **jumps** the cursor to that file's
section in the diff below (scrolling it to the top of the view). This makes the
diffstat a table of contents for the diff. The jump is recorded in the
jumplist, so `<C-o>` / `<C-i>` move back to the diffstat and forward to the diff
section as usual. When `<C-o>` would step back *out* of the commit view (its
next jump target is another buffer, or there is none left), it **closes the
commit view** instead of leaving its buffer — so `<C-o>` backs all the way out.
`<CR>` elsewhere in the view does nothing.

### 11.5 External diff

gitloom does not render a rich (side-by-side, syntax-highlighted) diff itself;
it **delegates** to an external diff plugin through a pluggable provider
(§8 `diff`). The provider operates on a **range**, not a single commit, so
richer commit selections on the graph can reuse it later (commit-vs-commit,
commit-vs-working-tree, a tag range, …); a single commit is just one way to
construct a range.

A `DiffRange` is `{ rev, from?, to }`: `rev` is a git rev-range the diff tool
understands (e.g. `<hash>^!` for a commit's own changes, `<a>..<b>` for a span,
or an empty-tree range for a root commit), and `from`/`to` are the structured
endpoint commits (`from` is `nil` for a root). The provider's `open(range)` is
called to display it; the default opener runs diffview on `range.rev` and, when
diffview is not installed, reports that instead of erroring. Overriding `open`
(and `label`) switches to another diff plugin — diffview is therefore an
**optional dependency**, not required.

Two entry points construct a single-commit range (`<hash>^!`, or an empty-tree
range for a root) and call the provider:

- the graph's `D` key, on the commit under the cursor (§2);
- the commit view's **action label** — the first line, where the cursor parks on
  open (§11.2) — activated with `<CR>`.

The action label text is `diff.label` (default `▶ Open diff (diffview)`),
highlighted with `palette.action`. When no provider is configured (`diff.open`
is unset) the label is omitted and `D` is a no-op.

Planned: graph-side range selection (building on the §2 selection substrate and
§10 view work) to pick two commits and feed the same provider.

## 12. Reachability emphasis

The row under the cursor defines a **pivot** commit. gitloom continuously
de-emphasises everything not causally related to the pivot, so the pivot's
history and what descends from it stand out.

### 12.1 The causal cone

The pivot's **cone** is computed by walking the **Lane graph** (§5) from the
pivot in two monotonic sweeps:

- **ancestors** — follow `parent_lanes` (each leads to a parent), recursing;
- **descendants** — follow `child_lanes` (each leads to a child), recursing.

Every Lane reached is set `highlighted`, and the commits it connects (`begin`,
`end`) form the cone. Because each Lane is one edge, the walk is exact: at a
shared fan, the pivot's edge is a distinct Lane from a sibling's, so only the
pivot's edges light. Each sweep never reverses direction, so the cone is exactly
the commits causally related to the pivot — not the whole connected component.

The walk stays within the **currently visible rows**. Because rows are in
topological order (a parent is always at a later row than its child), restricting
to the contiguous viewport loses nothing about relationships *between* on-screen
commits — it only clips the *recursion* at the viewport edges. A cone Lane whose
far endpoint is off-screen is still highlighted (its on-screen stub lights); the
walk simply does not recurse past it.

### 12.2 Dimming

Content **outside** the cone is rendered **dimmed**; the cone keeps full colour:

- a commit **row** — its date, author, message, refs, and commit marker — dims
  when that commit is not in the cone (not a `begin`/`end` of any highlighted
  Lane);
- a **Segment** dims unless a Lane it carries is highlighted. Because a Segment
  carries the exact edge(s) it draws (§5.1), a cone wire stays lit through every
  split and merge it passes — including a shared fan bus, where the Segment is
  lit only when one of *its* routing edges is in the cone — while an unrelated
  bar it crosses stays dim.

A Column's glyph takes the colour of a highlighted Lane it carries when one is
present (so the cone colour wins a shared cell), else the §5 default; it dims
unless one of its Segments' Lanes is highlighted.

Dimming preserves colour identity rather than flattening to one grey: each
field's / Lane's own highlight colour is blended toward the window background by
`palette.dim` (§8), so a dimmed Lane keeps its hue and stays individually
recognisable. On terminals without true colour, dimming falls back to a single
flat highlight group (`NonText`).

The emphasis is **on by default** and follows the cursor; it is recomputed when
the cursor moves to a new row. `H` toggles it off and on live (and `highlight`
configures the initial state, §8) — when off, the whole graph renders at full
colour, **identical regardless of the cursor row** (highlight state never affects
colour while it is off).

Planned: lane-anchored navigation — selecting a Lane (`h`/`l`) and stepping
along it commit-to-commit (`j`/`k`) via its `begin`/`end`, with splits and
merges stepping in visual order — building on this Lane model and the §2
selection substrate.
